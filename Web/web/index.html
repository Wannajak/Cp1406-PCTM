<legend><h2>About CossiePlay</h2> </legend>
<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra was formed in Townsville in 2000 after a workshop conducted by Richard McIntyre from Canberra. Over the past 15 years it has gone from strength to strength and now presents three main concerts a year, as well as smaller concerts such as the childrenâ€™s concert Peter and the Wolf in 2014. We are a community orchestra, drawing players from a large cross section of the Townsville community and sometimes beyond. All are drawn together by their great love of orchestral music and desire to provide North Queensland with quality performances. Depending on the program up to 50 musicians play a wide ranging repertoire which has included some of the great orchestral compositions such as the New World Symphony by Dvorak and most of the Beethoven symphonies as well as Tchaikovsky and Bizet. </p>
